<h1>About Silly Clicky Things</h1>

<p>
Welcome to <strong>Silly Clicky Things</strong> — the tiny corner of the internet where nothing serious happens
</p>

<p>
I’m Kate, a human person who really should be doing sensible adult, boring things.
Instead  I spend my evenings creating <em>pointless little games</em> like 
“Tap the Lucky Rabbit Paw”, “CatXP” and whatever other nonsense my brain 
cooks up at some ungodly hour. With a good strong cuppa and mischievous cat close by.
</p>

<h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>

<p>
Because life is stressful enough. Sometimes you don’t want a productivity app, a 
30-day challenge or a life-changing masterclass. Sometimes you just want to 
<strong>click a potato</strong> and feel a tiny micro-dose of joy. 
</p>

<p>
This site is a growing collection of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple clicker games</li>
  <li>Weird little generators</li>
  <li>Pointless digital toys</li>
  <li>Animals and inanimate objects that judge you, fart, or encourage you, depending on their mood</li>
  <li>Pure, wholesome, “I should be doing something else” energy</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you’re bored, procrastinating, avoiding responsibilities, taking a break from doomscrolling, 
or just need something silly to brighten your day... it's OK. You’re in the right place.
</p>

<h2>The Grand Plan</h2>

<p>
Build a huge collection of fun, free mini-games that people can tap, poke, 
pet, boop, slap, sparkle, shout at or otherwise interact with. Think of it as an arcade full of 
digital fidget toys, weird vibes and (perhaps) questionable life choices. 
</p>

<p>
I am also attempting to escape the 9–5 and build something joyful on the internet. I'm over being a serious person who does serious, grown up things
If that resonates with you then welcome to the club! Feel free to bring snacks. Preferably custard.
</p>

<h2>What’s Coming Next?</h2>

<p>
More games. More categories. More animals. More silly noises and unabashed AI art.  
And probably a few ideas that make me question my own sanity, but I’ll ship them anyway.
</p>

<p>
If you want updates, check the homepage occasionally or follow along on Pinterest and TikTok. 
I’m building this whole thing out loud.
</p>


<p>
If you're still reading, wow. And thanks! You're a good egg.
