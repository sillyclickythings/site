                          Welcome to <strong>Silly Clicky Things</strong> — the tiny corner of the internet where nothing serious happens
                      </p>

                      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                      <p>
                      I’m Kate, a human person who really should be doing sensible adult, boring things.
                      Instead  I spend my evenings creating <em>pointless little games</em> like 
                      “Lucky Rabbit Paw”, “CatXP” or whatever other nonsense my brain 
                      dreams up. With a good strong cuppa and mischievous cat close by.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>

                      <p>
                      Because life is stressful enough. Sometimes you don’t want a productivity app, a
                      life-changing masterclass or god forbid, yet another
                      36,921.80 day challenge. Sometimes you just want to 
                      <strong>click a potato</strong> and feel a tiny micro-dose of joy. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      This site is a growing collection of:
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Simple clicker games</li>
                        <li>Weird little generators</li>
                        <li>Pointless digital toys</li>
                        <li>Animals and inanimate objects that judge you, fart, or encourage you, depending on their mood</li>
                        <li>Pure, wholesome, “I should be doing something else” energy</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                      If you’re bored, procrastinating, avoiding responsibilities, taking a break from doomscrolling, 
                      or just need something silly to brighten your day... it's OK. You’re in the right place.
                      </p>

                      <h2>The Grand Plan</h2>

                      <p>
                      Build a huge collection of fun, free mini-games that people can tap, poke, 
                      pet, boop, slap, sparkle, shout at or otherwise interact with. Think of it as an arcade full of 
                      digital fidget toys, weird stuff and questionable life choices. 
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      I am also attempting to escape the 9–5 and build something joyful on the internet. I'm over being a serious person who does serious, grown up things
                      If that resonates with you then welcome to the club! Feel free to bring snacks. Preferably custard.
                      </p>

                      <h2>What’s Coming Next?</h2>

                      <p>
                      More games. More categories. More animals. More silly noises and AI art.  
                      And probably a few ideas that make me question my own sanity, but I’ll ship them anyway.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      If you want updates, check the homepage occasionally or follow along on Pinterest and TikTok.

                      If you're still reading, wow. And thanks! You're a good egg.🥚
